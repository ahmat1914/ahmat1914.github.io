From https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/C/caas-containers-as-a-service.html By Forrest Stroud

> Containers-as-a-Service (CaaS) is an emerging services offering for container-based virtualization in which providers offer a complete framework to customers for deploying and managing containers, applications and clusters.

> The Containers-as-a-Service model is designed to help both developers and IT departments develop, run and manage containerized applications. In a CaaS model, containers and clusters are provided as a service that can be deployed in on-premises data centers or over the cloud.


Why is CaaS important?

From https://www.ibm.com/services/cloud/containers-as-a-service

> A model with broad application, CaaS helps developers streamline the process of constructing a fully scaled container and applications deployment. The model is a boon for IT departments, providing an enabled container deployment service that has governance control in a security-rich environment. The CaaS model helps enterprises simplify container management within their software-defined infrastructures.
