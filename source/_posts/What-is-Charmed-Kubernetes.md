> Containers as a Service

> Charmed Kubernetes provides a well integrated, turn-key KubernetesÂ® platform that is open, extensible, and secure.

> Kubernetes uses Container Network Interface (CNI) as an interface between network providers and Kubernetes networking. 

> Canonical delivers a standardised set of open source log aggregation and systems monitoring dashboards with every cloud, using Prometheus, the Elasticsearch and Kibana stack (ELK), and Nagios.
